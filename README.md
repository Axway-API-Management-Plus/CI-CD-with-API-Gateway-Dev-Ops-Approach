# CI-CD-with-API-Gateway-Dev-Ops-Approach


This document is regarding the full cycle CI-CD with API-Gateway. The idea is to start using the dev-ops tools like Jenkins, Gitlab and SOAP-UI. For the basic training we will use Jenkins, SOAP-UI, Gitlab and API gateway with Team development option enable. We will focus first on installing each component and then configure each of them.

### CI (Continuous Integration) service is a part of team development that build and test the software whenever developer pushes code to application. 

### CD (Continuous Deployment) is a software service that places the changes of every code in the production which results in every day deployment of production.


### Goals :-

	Remove conflicts in Team Development & Increase efficiency of the Team.

	Automation testing at each development stage to perform regression and non-regression testing.
	
	Have a full governance on what is being deployed and validate using Policy studio and Gitlab.
