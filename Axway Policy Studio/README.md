# Axway Policy Studio

This document is regarding the advantages of policy studio and how it could help in CI-CD flow.

Enable team development in policy studio

First go to "Window" option then "Preferences"  Select "Team Development" and enable this option.

Now create a new project from template

Now you would be able to see the "Team Development"  options where you need to create the project one with Server settings and one without server settings.

Now you have created 2 project one that has your Server settings and one that has your project.

The idea here is to keep these break the fed into different projects so that multiple team members could work together on a same fed at the same time without overwriting on each other development. This increases the efficiency of the development team exponentially.

You can also use the Axway Policy studio to compare two different fed files that has complex changes in between and cannot be validated using the Gitlab Changes Validation

### Advantages :-
	
	This is a very useful feature that is used by the GitLab administrator to validate what kind of changes are going to be deployed on the API Gateway Env.

	This gives a clear idea of how many additions, deletions, Conflicts and then calculate the total difference between two projects. 
	
	GitLab can't provide the clear information of policy filter level changes but Policy studio merge options can give such features that help in policy validation & administration.
